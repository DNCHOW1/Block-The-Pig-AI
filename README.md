# Block-The-Pig-Bot

Simulates Block the Pig, a hex grid maze-like game. In the original game, the player is allowed two free moves to block in the grid, where each subsequent block the pig can move. The game ends once the pig reaches an edge, or the player completely restricts pig from reaching an edge. 

The core part of this project, however, is the Bot that plays against the pig. Using a Monte-Carlo Tree Search, the bot plays through multiple games to determine the next block that achieves an absolute win.
